# PDB-PLIP Bside Interaction

For details of PLIP please see: https://plip-tool.biotec.tu-dresden.de/plip-web/plip/index

An example of how interactions can be used in practice: https://academic.oup.com/nar/article/49/W1/W530/6266421?login=true

## Goal
The main goal is to create a tool that generates a representative and searchable active side 
representation form plip out xml files and/or PDB files 

Should also be applicable on PDB files generated by docking software that was inputted to 
PLIP

## Installation 
1. Clone project 
2. If not done install anaconda
3. Create new conda env. from provided .yml file
4. Run code :D

## Aims of alpha version 

Plip_XML_File_Handel.py --> Sampel of how to get the proteins active side info from a plip out .xml file 

PDB_File_handling.py --> Get eventually an active side and/or sequence
